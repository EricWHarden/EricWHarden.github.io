# ***3. Software Design/Engineering***

  The artifact chosen for the software design and engineering portion of the ePortfolio is the final project from my CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course in July/August of 2022. The project itself is a mobile application intended to be used by a small/medium business or individual seller for product inventory management. It uses a grid-based view to display input products, stores and displays a number of related informative aspects like name and price, has user profiles with associated credentials (including functionality to login or signup), and allows for C.R.U.D. functionality with all related data. This was one of three options for the project, and it was developed in Android Studio using Java as its primary programming language.
	
	I selected this item for my ePortfolio as it is the most complete application I have developed during my time in the computer science program and it falls within the criteria for the software design and engineering category. I believe this artifact showcases my ability to work with the Java language as well as my ability to create more complex programs, working with various interconnected classes and functions, working with mobile architecture, and my ability to design user-friendly interfaces for interacting with applications. In terms of improvements to the existing artifact, I took the time to go through and clean up the existing code, adding in a bit more clarity in readability as well as cutting down on redundancies. I also took time to make the user-interface more accessible as well as fixing existing errors in the program that could have created issues in compiling or potentially with security if left unchecked.
	
	The course objective was to take the artifact and enhance it in some form or fashion, and in addition to the minor improvements I added to the existing code, the primary enhancement I chose to perform on this project was to convert the existing code from the Java language to Kotlin. I chose to translate the project to Kotlin as it is the only other language officially supported by Google for Android development, and while I am fresh to this language, it does share a number of similarities to Java, and I took it as a personal challenge. This was one of the presented options for potential enhancements to perform with our chosen artifacts, and at this time I do not have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans, at least not regarding this particular project.
	
	The process of enhancing this artifact was a genuine trial. I have very little experience with translating from one programming language to another, and what little I do have is largely reverse engineering work taking assembly and turning it into C++. I debated on translating the project from Java into Python or C++, as I have more experience with both of the latter languages. But, using either for an Android application was proving to be somewhat troublesome as there is no direct way of doing so that I could immediately find, and finding a proper IDE to put it all together was becoming a headache. As previously stated I have no experience with Kotlin prior to taking on this endeavor, and so I had to do a fair bit of research into how the language works, how to translate from Java, what kind of IDE I would need to be working with, and more. Luckily, Android Studio does have some conversion software built in, and this assisted with a good deal of the translation, though it was definitely not a one-to-one instant transformation. Following the initial conversion, a number of errors appeared in the new iteration of the project, and I had to spend a fair deal of additional time researching these errors and correcting them in order to gain the same functionality and ensure the program would compile.
